# TRC-11
Bilkent EEE-211 Analog Electronics term project.

HF (High-Frequency) transceiver (transmitter-receiver), “TRC-11”, operating in the 11-meter amateur band. 

Discrete passive components and active integrated circuits are introduced and employed in the course to implement the analog signal processing. In this project power supplies, integrated circuits as active devices, audio amplifiers, speakers, radio amplifiers, filters, oscillators, mixers and antennas are progressively used and implemented.
